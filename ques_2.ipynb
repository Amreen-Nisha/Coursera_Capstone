    "According to American Moving Statistics, 32 million people in the US moved in 2018, that is 10.1% of the population of 319 million US residents. The reasons for moving cities varied from Wanting new or better home/apartment to new job/job transfer/other job related reasons. Also, Rober Half's survey shows that 62% of workers said they would relocate for a job.\n",

    "When relocating, some people struggle to figure out which area they should look into, mainly because a lot of times they don't know much about the new city they're moving to. The basis of this project is to help people, who are relocating and don't know much about the city they're moving to, easily compare cities and recommend possible locations/neighborhoods that they might be interested in. It does this by exploring venue-based city-to-city simialrity measures, clustering neighborhoods within a city, and looking at housing requirements and prices as well as crime rates.\n",
